<LI>LICENSING INFORMATION
<OL><LI>As of April 1, 1996, those who have valid amateur qualifications mentioned in <A HREF="#annex1">Annex 1</A> are eligible to establish and operate an amateur station in Japan, regardless of their nationality.
    <LI>Station output power is used to classify amateur stations in Japan. It is recommended you request a portable/mobile 50-watts station for use anywhere in Japan.
    <LI>A separate license for a fixed station is necessary if you wish to operate more than 50 watts in addition to a portable/mobile station. A fee is charged for each license.
    <LI>After the application is approved, your Japanese amateur radio license will be forwarded to the Japanese mailing address stated in item 6 of station information (JARL-96-04).
    <LI>You may use JARL's address for item 7 if you choose mobile/portable station, and you can receive your license at JARL's office in Tokyo by presenting your passport or any other kind of ID. In this case, please state "HOLD MY LICENSE AT JARL" in item 6. 
    <LI>Station licenses will be granted for a period of one year, renewable at 4,350 Yen per year, but in any case not beyond the expiration date of your certificate. Five-year licenses are available for those who hold "PERMISSION FOR PERMANENT RESIDENCE" (visa category 4-1-14) from Minister of Justice, Japan, but proof of this visa status must be provided with your application.
    <LI>Payments can be made either by bank transfer to JARL's account or by International Money Order payable in yen to the Japan Amateur Radio League. Paying bank information:
<PRE>
Bank Name:    Tokyo-Mitsubishi Bank,   Komagome Branch
Bank Address: 3-1, Komagome 2-chome, Toshima-ku, Tokyo 170
JARL's Account No: Bank #0005, Branch #061, Checking Account #9003391
Reason for remittance: Reciprocal Amateur Radio License
</PRE>
    <LI>Fees payable for station license are:
<PRE>
50 watts or less       Yen 12,000 (mobile/portable)
More than 50 watts,    Yen 21,000 (fixed only)
but 200 watts or less
</PRE>
     <LI>A different application procedure is necessary if you plan to run
more than 200 watts output. Applications using the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications (MPT) specified form, all filled out in Japanese, must be
made directly to the Regional Bureau of Telecommunications (RBT) in the call
district in which you will set-up your station during your stay in Japan.
After approval by RBT, you must go through on-site inspection of your
station by RBT before being granted your license. This procedure may take more than three months. Please contact JARL (<A HREF="#jarl">see item 2</A>) beforehand for more details.
