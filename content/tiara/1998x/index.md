On Sunday afternoon, December 13th, many Tokyo International
Amateur Radio Association (TIARA) members met at the Fest Brau
large beer hall of
Yebisu Garden Place](https://gardenplace.jp/)
for our annual Christmas Party.  Otsuka-san, JF1NIW, brought along his
Fujifilm MX-700 digital camera to capture some of the happenings.

Following lunch, we heard from JARL President Hara-san.  Included in his remarks was the news that starting in 1999, the Ham Fair will be held in
Yokohama.
Fujioka-san was kept busy providing the interpretation.
