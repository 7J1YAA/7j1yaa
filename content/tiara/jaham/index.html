<LI>Introduction
<BR> In Japan, the radio regulatory administration is a function
of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT). The MPT
is responsible for the supervision of radio communications on the
basis of the Radio Law enacted in 1950.
<P> Japan has enacted Radio Law and those of the related Cabinet
Orders and MPT ordinances in line with the International Radio
Regulations and international agreements on radio communications.
<P>The main points of authority and function are:
<ul>
<li>          to grant radio station licenses,</li>
<li>          to inspect radio stations,</li>
<li>          to monitor and regulate the use of radio frequencies,</li>
<li>          to grant licenses to radio operator,</li>
<li>          to set the technical standard for radio equipment, and</li>
<li>          to foster and promote the utilization of radio waves.</li>
</ul>
     Procedures and operating requirement of amateur radio
stations are similar to those of other kind of radio stations.</li>

<li>Licensing system
<ol>
<li>Radio station license

     Any person who intends to establish a radio station should
obtain  a licence from the Minister of Posts and Telecommunica-
tions (Article 4 of the Radio Law), whereas no radio station
licence is granted to any person who does not have the Japanese
nationality (Article 5 of the Radio Law). With regard to an
amateur radio station*, however, the aliens are able to obtain
its licence in this country (same Article as the latter).
<ul>
<li>     The term "amateur radio station" means a station in the
     amateur radio service.</li>

<li>     The term "amateur radio service" means a radio communica-
     tion service for the purpose of self-training, intercom-
     munication and technical investigations carried out by duly
     authorized persons interested in radio technique solely with
     a personal aim and without pecuniary interest (Article 3 of
     the Ordinance for Executing the Radio Law), as defined in
     the Radio Regulations of the International Telecommunication
     Union.</li>
</ul></li>
<li> Persons permitted to operate a radio station

     No other persons than "radio operators"* are in a position
to operate amateur radio stations in Japan (Article 39-3 of the
Radio Law); however, any person who holds a qualification,
recognized as being equivalent to one of a Japanese Amateur Radio
Operator's Certificate, issued by one of the countries having
reciprocal agreement with Japan, may be permitted to do so, even
if he is not a "radio operator" defined in the Radio Law (Same
Article as above, and Article 33 of the Ordinance for Executing
the Radio Law).
