<P>Brent Bossom / 7J1ANN has led an effort to get the TIARA Emergency
Communications Plan more organized.</P>
<p>
The plan co-ordinates the efforts of TIARA with
those of the amateur radio clubs at two of the large US military
installations on the Kanto Plain.
The JAARAY club at Yokota AFB and the Yokosuka Navy Base club
provide out-lying link points in an attempt to have coverage
throughout the area.
<p>
In the event of an emergency, TIARA members are encouraged to
appear on one (or more) of the following frequencies:
<pre>
   21.325 USB
   28.800 USB
  145.66  FM
  438.20  FM
</pre>
Given the wide physical separation of all of the participants in
the plan, it is very unlikely that all of them will be seriously
affected by the same natural disaster.  Members should be able
to get "Health and Welfare" information messages out to an
unaffected site for relay to relatives abroad.
<H2>Tests</H2>
<P>Occasional tests are held to verify connectivity of the participating
members.  Watch the
<A HREF="/7j1yaa/index.html#mailinglists">mailing lists</A>
for details.</P>
