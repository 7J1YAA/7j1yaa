      <p>First of all,  many thanks to all the club officers and both
      members and non-members for your support over the years. We are
      grateful to be able to celebrate this milestone in our club’s
      history.</p>
      <p>A party was held in Ginza, Tokyo on Saturday evening, 25 August
      2012.  There were a lot of familiar faces, including some that
      are currently living overseas.  Bill Stenson, 7J1AAB, prepared
      some <a href="/7j1yaa/TIARA_40th_Bill_7J1AAB/">closing
      remarks</a> that sum up the first 40 years of the club.</p>

<h3>Background for Using the Special Events Call W6J</h3>

<p>TIARA was founded in Tokyo in 1972 with the two main purposes. The
first, to establish a forum for foreign hams to meet each other and
local Japanese hams. The second, to pursue the goal of foreign hams
being able to operate in Japan with their own personal call sign
(foreigners at that timewere only allowed to use Japanese club call
signs based on rather strict operating procedure requirements).  In 1985
through the hard work and efforts of many,TIARA club officers and
members, the reciprocal licensing agreement between the United States
and Japan was approved by the related governments in 1985.  This paved
the way for the issuance of personal call signs with the prefix “7J” to
foreigners living in Japan.   The call W6J (W6 Japan) was selected as
the special events call to celebrate TIARA’s 40th anniversary and the
reciprocal licensing agreement.</p>
